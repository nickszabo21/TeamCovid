  <p>The first case of COVID-19 in US was reported 119 days ago on 1/22/2020. Since then, the country has reported 1,577,147 cases, and 94,702 deaths.

<p>This analysis uses a 5-day moving average to visualize the number of new COVID-19 cases and calculate the rate of change. This is calculated for each day by averaging the values of that day, the two days before, and the two next days. This approach helps prevent major events (such as a change in reporting methods) from skewing the data. The interactive charts below show the daily number of new cases for the 10 most affected countries, based on the reported number of deaths by COVID-19 per 100,000 population and having more than 1 million inhabitants.

  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Using SciKit-Learn</h3>
  <p>When taking the idea of applying Machine Learning to the tricky situation of COVID-19 one of the first parts we thought about are what climactic features may effect the number of cases that are found. The feature we had heard a lot about on the news, yet found very low data to support was the affect of temperature on the virus. This was the main idea we hoped to prove or disprove. With little available data regarding the virus this was a tough task.
